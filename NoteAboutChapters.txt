Rancher -- chapter 9

Will read over but will not do as very similar to portainer

first and main reason is;
"The differences start with the installation process. Rancher does
not currently support Docker for Mac or Docker for Windows. If you
are using these platforms, you must use a local virtual machine
running Ubuntu 16.04 or higher with a minimum of 1 GB of RAM."

--- Notes ---
rancher seam to be more configured for hosted VMs, connects to AWS,
DigitalOcean and Azure.




Docker Cloud -- chapter 10

docker own management GUI, again run on host and connects to cloud
provisioner. might wanna set it up for AWS
