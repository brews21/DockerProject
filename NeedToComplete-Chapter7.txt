Docker Swarm

Summary
In this chapter, we explored Docker Swarm. We took a look at how to
install Docker Swarm and the Docker Swarm components, which make up
Docker Swarm. We took a look at how to use Docker Swarm: joining,
listing, and managing Swarm manager and worker nodes. We reviewed
the service and stack commands and how to use them and spoke about
the Swarm inbuilt ingress load balancer, overlay networks, and
scheduler.

In the next three chapters, we are going to be taking a look at some
GUI applications that you can utilize to manage your Docker hosts,
containers, and images. They are some very powerful tools and choosing
one can be difficult so let's cover all three starting with Portainer.
