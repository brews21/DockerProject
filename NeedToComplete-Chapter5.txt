chapter 5 -- DockerMachine

-- launching a VM in VirtualBox
-- launching a VM in AWS

Summary
In this chapter, we looked at Docker Machine. We first looked at how
to use Docker Machine to create the Docker hosts locally on VirtualBox
and reviewed the commands you can use to both interact with and manage
your Docker Machine-launched Docker hosts. We then looked at how to use
Docker Machine to deploy Docker hosts to your cloud environments, namely
DigitalOcean and Amazon Web Services.

While we had three Docker Machine-managed hosts online, we took a look
at multihost container networking by installing and configuring Weave Net
by Weave. Once Weave Net was installed, we launched our multi-container
application, but this time, we launched the containers on different
Docker hosts.

Finally, we took a very quick look at how to launch two different
container-optimized Linux operating systems, CoreOS and RancherOS,
and the differences between them.

I am sure you will agree that using Docker Machine made running these
tasks, which typically have very different approaches, a very consistent
experience, which in the long run will save a lot of time as well as
explaining.

In the next chapter, we will look at Docker Compose to launch
multi-container applications. Docker Compose is a core component of the 
Docker ecosystem that you will find yourself using almost daily.
